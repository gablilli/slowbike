   - Cataloged all 27 images from Wix CDN
   - Created extraction utility (`extract_wix_content.py`)

2. **Phase 1: Home Page - COMPLETE** ✅

   - Integrated preloader animation
   - Full navigation and route cards
   - Completely Wix-free

### 🎨 Demo Features

The demo page includes:

- ✅ Hero section: "pedala con noi nel territorio di Gubbio"
- ✅ 6 route cards with images and descriptions
- ✅ Partners section
- ✅ Footer
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code

### 🤔 Decision Needed: Two Approaches

#### Option A: Clean Rebuild (RECOMMENDED) ⭐
**What I've demonstrated with the demo**

Pros:
- ✅ Clean, readable HTML/CSS/JS
- ✅ Full control over functionality
- ✅ Easy to maintain and update
- ✅ Modern best practices
- ✅ No Wix framework bloat
- ✅ Proven to work (demo exists!)

Cons:
- ⏱️ Requires manual recreation of each page
- ⏱️ Need to verify visual match with original

Effort: Medium (but sustainable long-term)

#### Option B: Extract Wix JavaScript
**Try to make existing Wix code work standalone**

Pros:
- 🔍 Preserves exact Wix functionality

Cons:
- ❌ Very complex (56 script blocks)
- ❌ Depends on Wix "Thunderbolt" framework
- ❌ Hard to debug when issues arise
- ❌ Difficult to maintain
- ❌ May still need Wix CDN/services

Effort: High (with high technical debt)

### 📋 Next Steps (If Option A Chosen)

1. **Replace Index Page**
   - Remove iframe from `index.html`
   - Integrate standalone home page
   - Keep preloader animation

2. **Create All Subpages** (11 pages total)
   - percorsi.html
   - blog.html (needs blog system)
   - contattaci.html (contact form)
   - bevelle.html, bevello.html
   - laghetti-scagliae.html
   - mauretta.html
   - montecucco.html
   - tourcastelli.html
   - valdichiascio.html

3. **Handle Assets**
   - Download images to `/images` folder
   - Or keep on Wix CDN (they'll keep working)

4. **Blog System**
   - Create simple static blog
   - Or use lightweight CMS

5. **Testing**
   - Visual comparison with original
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile testing
   - Performance optimization

### 📊 Estimated Timeline (Option A)

- Home page integration: 1-2 hours
- Each subpage: 1-2 hours (11 pages = 11-22 hours)
- Blog system: 3-5 hours
- Testing & refinement: 5-10 hours
- **Total: ~20-40 hours of work**

### 🎉 Migration Complete!

**All pages are now standalone and Wix-free:**
- ✅ Home page (index.html)
- ✅ Percorsi overview
- ✅ All 6 route detail pages
- ✅ Blog page
- ✅ Contact page
- ✅ 404 error page

**The site is 100% operational without Wix!**
